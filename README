irssi-scripts is a collection of user-contributed and user-reviewed scripts for
irssi. Only scripts under a free software license should be in this repository.

This is meant for users who haven't had luck getting any irssi devs reviewing
their scripts for scripts.irssi.org which seems to be dead for extensive times.

Branches
========

master
  Reviewed scripts, should be safe to use

incoming
  New scripts and updates that have not yet been reviewed, use at your own risk!

Reviewing process
=================

1. New scripts or updates are added to the incoming branch.
2. New changes are reviewed by reviewer A:
   $ git checkout incoming
   $ git diff master..incoming
   $ git commit --allow-empty -m 'Reviewed by A' # empty commit is created to denote the review
3. New changes are reviewed by reviewer B; now they can be merged to master branch:
   $ git merge --no-ff incoming
